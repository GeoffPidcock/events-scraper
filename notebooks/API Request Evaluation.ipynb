That\\'s why at SydNLP #20 two startups will be taking the opportunity to walk us through the technical challenges and discoveries they\\'ve made to date on their journey, in the complex fields of natural language understanding and generation.<br/>Hope to see you there! -- Team SydNLProc</p> <p>JOSH COMRIE AND GARETH CRONIN</p> <p>Title: Scaling Natural Language Understanding</p> <p>Abstract:</p> <p>At software scale-up Ambit we have created an enterprise conversation platform with a business-user-friendly code-free user experience for building natural language models and scripting conversations. We have dozens of enterprise customers in New Zealand and Australia and are taking the platform global.</p> <p>Join founders Josh Comrie and Gareth Cronin. Josh will discuss the birth and growth of Ambit, some customer case studies and his unique perspective as an angel investor and startup founder raising money. Gareth will focus on some of the challenges of building the platform, the role of machine learning, off-the-shelf \"AI\" cloud services, our vision for non-linear automated conversations, and the future of conversations in the large for enterprise businesses.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Josh Comrie<br/>Josh is an Entrepreneur, Investor and Company Director. He’s a founder and the CEO of Ambit: a New Zealand founded AI Conversation Platform company. He’s invested in over 20 NZ hi-tech startups, so is behind some of NZ’s most successful technology exports. He acts as an director and adviser to several and Chair of one. Prior to his AI ventures, he has a background in human capital solutions, having founded and exited from 3 highly successful brands. He has been described as a serial entrepreneur.</p> <p>Gareth Cronin<br/>Gareth is CTO of Ambit, looking after product and technology vision, strategy, and execution. He is also an Executive General Manager at Xero, the cloud accounting and small business platform. Prior to founding Ambit and joining Xero, Gareth consulted for Air New Zealand and Vista Entertainment, led engineering at crime analytics software business Wynyard Group, at health software creator Orion Health, and at manufacturing software vendor Kiwiplan. Gareth serves on the board of the IT Professionals New Zealand\\'s (ITP) national tertiary degree accreditation programme under the Seoul Accord, and the advisory panel for the Auckland ICT Grad School. Gareth left an earlier career as a piano teacher and musician to graduate with a BSc(Hons) in Computer Science, work as a software developer, and later complete an MBA at the University of Auckland.</p> <p>TIM GARNSEY</p> <p>Title: Caring about people’s privacy</p> <p>Abstract: Caring about people’s privacy can pay off in big ways these days. As well as avoid eye watering fines (hello GDPR!), assembling data sets and protecting your reputaiton are easier when you can show people you are looking out for their interests.</p> <p>In the last year or so a number of approaches have made this much easier to do - in many cases there may be no reason not to. In this talk, I’ll run through some of the pros and cons of newer approaches to privacy respecting language modelling.</p> <p>Bio: Tim is a founder of Certitude Id, a company that helps companies get value from data without damaging their customer’s privacy. He divides his time between productionising software products and sifting through the firehose of theoretical machine learning research.</p> <p>Prior to this Tim spent six years absorbed in machine learning and data related roles in financial services tech companies including Atlassian, Airtasker, Spaceship and Prospa.</p> ',\n",

Please make sure to register using the General Assembly event page, linked here: <a href=\"https://ga.co/2PPoZWd\" class=\"linkified\">https://ga.co/2PPoZWd</a></p> <p>****<br/>Abstract:<br/>There has been a lot of attention in the media surrounding the rise of automation. As advanced technologies such as robotic process automation, machine learning, and artificial intelligence have matured, companies have found practical applications to these new technologies.</p> <p>As part of this evolution, Intelligent Automation has become a topic of interest for business leaders across industries looking to combine cognitive capabilities with robotic process technologies to create a \"living\" system that can go beyond mundane and repeatable tasks. This is extremely advantageous to any organization that can implement these systems seamlessly but there is still a delta between the ideation of AI integration. and the ability to put these plans into effect.
